## DNS Resolver
In this project, we aim to become familiar with DNS, one of the most widely used protocols in the world of computer networks. The ultimate goal of this project is to implement programs that take an address name as input and, by searching the network using the DNS protocol, display the corresponding IP address as output.

## Telnet Client
In this project, we have implemented Telnet, a protocol that allows communication between two or more computers over the internet or networks.

## DHCP
In this project, we have implemented a DHCP Client and Server.
